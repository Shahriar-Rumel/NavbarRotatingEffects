                        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was the British wizarding school, located in the Scottish Highlands.It accepted magical students from Great Britain and Ireland for enrolment.It was a state-owned school, funded by the Ministry of Magic.

                        The precise location of the school could never be uncovered because it was rendered Unplottable. To Muggles, the school appeared to be an old, abandoned castle. Similarly, most wizarding schools' locations were protected in order to prevent their ways of teaching being revealed, as well as protect the students and schools themselves from any harm.
